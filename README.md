# 8-Ball Webb app

## Description
8-Ball is a random generated answering system to a user's questions. It's like the classic 8 ball answer toy.

This is a Codecademy portfolio project. It would have been a console application but I've decided to make it graphical.

## Techologies used:
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Git and Github

I'm also hosting it on GitHub.
